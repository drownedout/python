There are two main instances of recursion.

The first instance is when a function makes one or more calls to itself.

The second is when a data structure uses a smaller instance of the exact same type of
data structure when it represents itself.

** Why use recursion?

- Recursion provides a powerful alternative for performing repititions of tasks in which a loop
is not ideal

- Most modern programming languages use recursion

- Recursion serves as a great tool for building out particular data structures


The concept of 'base case'

Recursive case vs base case

Whenever you are trying to develop a recursive solution it is very important to think about the base case, as your solution will need to return to the 'base case' once all of the recursive cases have been worked through.
